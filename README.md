# Pokemon knox

As a child, I was captivated by retro games, especially Pokémon. With the franchise's growth, tracking its extensive lore became a daunting task. To address this, I harnessed my app development skills and created an all-encompassing Pokémon app, fully developed using Dart and Flutter. This app integrates PokeApi, a detailed API with comprehensive data from all the games. It has become an indispensable asset in tournament games offering a significant technological advantage.
